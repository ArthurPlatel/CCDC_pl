**LASSO Regression ( Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operator )**  

Lasso regression is mathematical model to do curve fitting of points.  
The python module is a standard all python apps/modules adhere to.  
Calculations are documented and consistent across platforms and applications.  

Inputs: observations, degrees of freedom ( mimimum number of coefficients )  

W = 2 * pi / 365.25  

Independent_arr [ column1 ] = observations  

if number of coefficients >= 4:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent_arr [ column2 ] = cos ( W * d ) for d in dates  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent_arr [ column3 ] = sin ( W * d ) for d in dates  

If df >= 6:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent_arr [ column4 ] = cos ( 2 * W * d ) for d in dates  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent_arr [ column5 ] = sin ( 2 * W * d ) for d in dates  

If df >= 8:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent_arr [ column6 ] = cos ( 3 * W * d ) for d in dates  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Independent_arr [ column7 ] = sin ( 3 * W * d ) for d in dates  

Regress  

Return fitted coefficients, RMSE, residuals ( actual - predicted )  

Minimum number of observations required for a fit is defined as:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of coefficients (4,6, or 8) * NUM_OBS_FACTOR (3)
